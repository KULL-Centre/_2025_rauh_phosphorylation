This repository contains code and data for:

Rauh A.S., Hedemark G., Tesei, G. & Lindorff-Larsen, K. (2025) _A coarse-grained model for simulations of phosphorylated disordered proteins_

The simulation data can be retrieved from the Electronic Research Data Archive at UCPH (ERDA): [here](https://sid.erda.dk/cgi-sid/ls.py?share_id=eWfx9y6b2c)

## Running CALVADOS simulations with PEG
PEG simulations can be run either with the code provided here or using the [CALVADOS package](https://github.com/KULL-Centre/CALVADOS)

## File structure
- **processed_data**: Pandas DataFrames with processed data from the simulations.
- **code**: Python scripts used in this study to run the simulations and perform the analysis.
- **residue_files**: Files containing the residue data for the different phosphorylation models used in this study. 
- **figures.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook with code to reproduce the figures in the manuscript.
